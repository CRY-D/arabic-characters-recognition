# Handwritten Arabic Characters Recognition 

In this repository, I implemented a proposed CNN in the paper "Arabic Handwritten Characters Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network" by El-Sawy, A., Loey, M., & Hazem, E. B. using Deeplearning4jlibrary.

### This repository contains:
- (ModelGenerator.java) to train the model with dataset - I provided it in dataset folder- and serialize the generated model to file (model.data). 
- The class TestModel.java is provided to test the generated model and using samples in (test_images) folder.
- I also provided a GUI application developed in java to test the generated model and it gives the best three scores for the input character.
